# TODO — Roadmap & Backlog

Pending build items, grounded in the codebase. Each maps to the standard
agentic-first pattern: **core service → REST + MCP tool → admin/storefront UI →
SKILL.md → tests**. Severity tags follow `AUDIT.md` (P0 = go-live blocker · P1 =
core capability gap · P2 = polish).

## Compliance, onboarding & migration (investigated 2026-06-06)

### 1. Legal pages — Terms of Use & Privacy Policy — ✅ BUILT
`LegalPolicy` model (TERMS / PRIVACY / SHIPPING / REFUND / COOKIES), versioned per
store. India/GST-aware template generator seeded from the seller tax identity +
return policy (`LegalService`, `legal/templates.ts`). Surfaces: REST `/legal`,
MCP (`generate_legal_policies`, `get_legal_policy`, `set_legal_policy`,
`publish_legal_policy`, `list_legal_policies`), admin **Legal** page, storefront
footer links + `/legal/:type` policy pages, `acp-legal` skill, tests.
- [x] (Follow-up) Buyer-acceptance capture at checkout — `LegalAcceptance` model records the policy versions in force per order/email. Acceptance is **implicit** (placing the order agrees to the published policies; passive notice, no blocking checkbox); `list_legal_acceptances` exposes the trail. The only checkout checkbox is the **optional marketing opt-in** (off by default) → sets `marketingConsent`. Promotional sends go only to opted-in; opted-out get order/delivery/return notices only (abandoned-cart recovery suppressed for unsubscribers).

### 2. eKYC / merchant verification & payouts — ❌ not built (P0 for real go-live)
Entirely absent — no `kyc` / `aadhaar` / `bankAccount` / `payout` / `ifsc` /
business-verification anywhere. `Store.gstin` / `Store.pan` exist **only as
invoice print identity** and are never verified. No payout/settlement model.
- [ ] `MerchantKyc` model: PAN, GSTIN, Aadhaar (ref/last4), bank account + IFSC, business type, status state machine (UNSUBMITTED → PENDING → VERIFIED / REJECTED).
- [ ] Pluggable `KycProvider` adapter (stub now, like the payment adapters; real GSTN / NSDL-PAN / Aadhaar / bank penny-drop need live creds — same constraint as P0-1).
- [ ] Gate go-live / payouts on VERIFIED; verify against the existing `gstin`/`pan` fields.
- [ ] Surfaces: REST `/kyc`, MCP tools, admin onboarding step, platform-operator review queue, skill, tests.

### 3. Bootstrap / migration agent (Shopify, WooCommerce, Dukaan) — ✅ BUILT
`StoreImportService` + `migration/parsers.ts` import **products or customers**
from Shopify / WooCommerce / Dukaan CSV exports (and a generic CSV/JSON shape)
onto a store via the existing services. Idempotent + resumable (skip by
title/SKU/email), `dryRun` preview, per-row report (`ImportJob`). Surfaces: REST
`/imports`, MCP (`import_store`, `list_imports`, `get_import`), admin
**Import / Migrate** wizard, `acp-migration` skill, tests with fixtures.
- [x] (Follow-up) Live API ingestion — `import_store_api` / `runFromApi` pulls from Shopify Admin API + WooCommerce REST (injectable fetch; paginated).
- [x] (Follow-up) Historical **order** import — maps status, backdates, links lines to variants by SKU + customers by email, idempotent by source ref.
- [x] (Follow-up) **Inventory** import — SKU→quantity stock sheet updates existing variants (ledger movement); plus `updateExisting` to refresh price/stock on product re-import.

**Remaining priority:** eKYC (item 2) — as a stubbed-adapter slice (real
verification needs live GSTN/PAN/bank credentials, like P0-1 payments).

## Already shipped (for context)
- **Returns & cancellation policy** — ✅ first-class, enforced (`ReturnPolicy` + `ReturnService`); storefront-visible; refunds + GST credit notes.
- **GST invoicing & accounting (items 1–4)** — ✅ seller tax identity, HSN/GST on products, tax invoice on capture (CGST/SGST/IGST by place of supply), credit notes on refund (tax-inclusive), sales register CSV + P&L-lite. See `AUDIT.md`.
- **Legal pages** — ✅ Terms/Privacy/Shipping/Refund/Cookies generator + storefront pages (item 1 above).
- **Store migration/bootstrap agent** — ✅ Shopify/WooCommerce/Dukaan import (item 3 above).

## Known roadmap (from AUDIT.md)
- [ ] P0-1: real Razorpay / GoKwik / WhatsApp / Delhivery / Resend / Msg91 / ESP adapters (stubs today; need live credentials).
- [ ] Multi-location / warehouse inventory (large architectural change).
- [ ] Buyer accounts / order history / saved addresses (currently guest-only storefront).
- [ ] Outstanding **P2** hardening items — see `AUDIT.md` P2 section.

## Authentication (audited + extended 2026-06-06 — see AUTH_AUDIT.md)
- [x] Audit platform / merchant+roles / partner auth planes.
- [x] Email + password (register/login/set) — scrypt.
- [x] Phone-number OTP login (hashed code, 5-min TTL, attempt lockout).
- [x] Google + Apple OAuth (tokeninfo / Apple JWKS; injectable verifier; OAuthIdentity linking).
- [x] TOTP two-factor (setup/enable/disable + login challenge/verify; encrypted secret).
- [x] 2FA + OAuth for **platform operators and partners** (Google/Apple sign-in for existing accounts only; TOTP challenge; self-serve Security page in both consoles).
- [ ] (Follow-up) Make merchant `requestMagicLink` enumeration-safe (match platform/partner planes).
- [ ] (Follow-up) Per-identifier rate-limiting on OTP/login at the edge; global SMS sender wired into OtpSender for real OTP delivery.
- [ ] (Follow-up) Passkeys/WebAuthn; phone-OTP/password on the operator/partner planes if desired.

## Catalog & merchandising (PRODUCT_AUDIT.md — all built 2026-06-07)
- [x] P0: storefront product images (gallery + card primary) + structured variant options & selection.
- [x] P1: categories (collections + membership), spec attributes, brand/type + faceted Shop filter.
- [x] P2: product document assets (datasheets/certs/size charts), warranty/compliance + variant logistics fields, B2B price tiers (applied at checkout).
- [ ] (Follow-up) Multi-batch inventory lots; serial/IMEI capture at fulfilment; gold-rate-linked jewellery pricing; weight/zone shipping rate cards; RFQ workflow.
